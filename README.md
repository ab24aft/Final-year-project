# Final-year-project
Climate change represents a critical global challenge, requiring data-driven approaches to understand evolving environmental patterns and support informed decision-making. This project analyses climate change trends using a multi-year dataset (2020–2024) containing key environmental indicators such as temperature, precipitation, CO₂ concentration, humidity, and urbanisation metrics. Comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing techniques were applied to address missing values, inconsistent formats, and extreme outliers, ensuring the reliability of subsequent analyses. Exploratory data analysis was conducted to investigate distributions, correlations, and variability across climate variables, revealing weak linear relationships and high data noise. Several machine learning models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), were developed and evaluated using cross-validation and error-based metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R². Time-series forecasting was also performed to assess predictive capability under real-world conditions. The results indicate limited predictive performance across all models, largely due to data sparsity, imbalance, and weak feature correlations. Feature importance analysis highlighted temperature and precipitation as the most influential predictors. Overall, the study emphasises the challenges of climate prediction using imperfect datasets and underscores the need for higher-quality data and more advanced modelling techniques to improve climate forecasting accuracy.
